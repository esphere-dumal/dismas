# dismas
Dismas is a simple Operator dispatching job into each nodes in a k8s cluster.

## Description
Dismas is built by Kubebuilder, and is able to be deployed by helmx

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

> Ensure there is kustomize and helm executable file in bin/

- Generate CRD files by controller-gen
```sh
make manifests
```

- Build the image by docker:
``` sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=esphe/dismas:latest
```
- Generate config file for helm by kustomize
``` sh
make helm
```
- Install in cluster
> Later I should upload the charts into repos
```sh
helm package deploy
helm install dismas dismas-deploy-0.1.0
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy charts
UnDeploy the charts from the cluster:

```sh
helm uninstall dismas
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```
